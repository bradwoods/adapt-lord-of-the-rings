                    The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in
                    secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had And&ucirc;ril but no
                    other weapon, and he went forth clad only in rusty green and
                    brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a long
                    sword, in fashion like And&ucirc;ril but of less lineage,
                    and he bore also a shield and his war-horn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the
                    hills,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and then let all the foes of
                    Gondor ﬂee!&rsquo; Putting it to his lips he blew a blast,
                    and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard
                    that voice in Rivendell sprang to their feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Slow should you be to wind that horn again,
                    Boromir,&rsquo; said Elrond, &lsquo;until you stand once
                    more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on
                    you.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;But always I have
                    let my horn cry at setting forth, and though thereafter we
                    may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth as a thief in
                    the night.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-
                    rings, for dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt
                    was a broad-bladed axe. Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and
                    at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore the
                    swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took
                    only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained
                    hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the
                    elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon
                    the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes,
                    and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food
                    and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a
                    pony, none other than the poor beast that they had brought
                    from Bree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on
                    him: he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth.
                    It was Sam who had insisted on choosing him, declaring that
                    Bill (as he called him) would pine, if he did not come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That animal can nearly talk,&rsquo; he said,
                    &lsquo;and would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He
                    gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: if you
                    don&rsquo;t let me go with you, Sam, I&rsquo;ll follow on my
                    own.&rsquo; So Bill was going as the beast of burden, yet he
                    was the only member of the Company that did not seem
                    depressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire,
                    and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet
                    come out of the house. A gleam of firelight came from the
                    open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows.
                    Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the door- step
                    beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees;
                    only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him.
                </p>
                <p>The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness.</p>
                <p>
                    Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring
                    moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below;
                    his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Bill, my lad,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
                    oughtn&rsquo;t to have took up with us. You could have
                    stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass
                    comes.&rsquo; Bill swished his tail and said nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously
                    in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it,
                    wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure,
                    his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always
                    carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of
                    pipe-weed (but not near enough, I&rsquo;ll warrant); ﬂint
                    and tinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings of
                    his master&rsquo;s that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had
                    stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called
                    for. He went through them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Rope!&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;No rope! And only
                    last night you said to yourself: &lsquo;&lsquo;Sam, what
                    about a bit of rope? You&rsquo;ll want it, if you
                    haven&rsquo;t got it.&rsquo;&rsquo; Well, I&rsquo;ll want
                    it. I can&rsquo;t get it now.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called
                    the Company to him. &lsquo;This is my last word,&rsquo; he
                    said in a low voice. &lsquo;The Ring-bearer is setting out
                    on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid:
                    neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any
                    servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it, save
                    members of the Company and the Council, and only then in
                    gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, to
                    help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn
                    aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you
                    go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or
                    bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you do
                    not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot
                    foresee what each may meet upon the road.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Faithless is he that says farewell when the road
                    darkens,&rsquo; said Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; said Elrond, &lsquo;but let him not vow
                    to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,&rsquo;
                    said Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Or break it,&rsquo; said Elrond. &lsquo;Look not too
                    far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may
                    the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.
                    May the stars shine upon your faces!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Good ... good luck!&rsquo; cried Bilbo, stuttering
                    with the cold. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you will be able
                    to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full
                    account when you get back. And don&rsquo;t be too long!
                    Farewell!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many others of Elrond&rsquo;s household stood in the shadows
                    and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices.
                    There was no laughter, and no song or music. At last they
                    turned away and faded silently into the dusk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep
                    paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they
                    came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed
                    through the heather. Then with one glance at the Last Homely
                    House twinkling below them they strode away far into the
                    night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning
                    southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands.
                    Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains
                    for many miles and days. The country was much rougher and
                    more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in
                    Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going
                    would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the
                    notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto
                    seldom been seen in this empty country, and the paths were
                    little known except to the people of Rivendell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew
                    this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind,
                    and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and
                    Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many
                    sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the
                    east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching
                    fingers. Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt
                    warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during
                    the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden
                    under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many
                    places. In the late afternoon they were roused by the watch,
                    and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for
                    they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In the
                    evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as
                    they could find a way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked
                    and stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping for-
                    ward like snails, and getting nowhere. Each day the land
                    looked much the same as it had the day before. Yet steadily
                    the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell they
                    rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of
                    the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak
                    hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths
                    were few and winding, and led them often only to the edge of
                    some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather
                    changed. The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the
                    south. The swift-ﬂowing clouds lifted and melted away, and
                    the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a cold clear
                    dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The
                    travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-
                    trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to have been built out
                    of the very stone of the hills. Their dark leaves shone and
                    their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty
                    mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the
                    Company was taking. At the left of this high range rose
                    three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth
                    tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was
                    still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted
                    upon it, it glowed red.

                <p>
                    Gandalf stood at Frodo&rsquo;s side and looked out under his
                    hand. &lsquo;We have done well,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We
                    have reached the borders of the country that Men call
                    Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion
                    was its name. Five-and- forty leagues as the crow ﬂies we
                    have come, though many long miles further our feet have
                    walked. The land and the weather will be milder now, but
                    perhaps all the more dangerous.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty
                    welcome,&rsquo; said Frodo, throwing back his hood and
                    letting the morning light fall on his face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But the mountains are ahead of us,&rsquo; said
                    Pippin. &lsquo;We must have turned eastwards in the
                    night.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But you see further
                    ahead in the clear light. Beyond those peaks the range bends
                    round south-west. There are many maps in Elrond&rsquo;s
                    house, but I suppose you never thought to look at
                    them?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Yes I did, sometimes,&rsquo; said Pippin, &lsquo;but
                    I don&rsquo;t remember them. Frodo has a better head for
                    that sort of thing.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I need no map,&rsquo; said Gimli, who had come up
                    with Legolas, and was gazing out before him with a strange
                    light in his deep eyes. &lsquo;There is the land where our
                    fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of
                    those mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and
                    into many songs and tales. They stand tall in our dreams:
                    Baraz, Zirak, Shath&#251;r.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking
                    life, but I know them and their names, for under them lies
                    Khazad-d&#251;m, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the
                    Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands
                    Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are
                    Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol
                    the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushath&#251;r.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their
                    arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot for- get:
                    Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, which the Elves call
                    Nanduhirion.&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="hollin2">
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,&rsquo;
                    said Gandalf. &lsquo;If we climb the pass that is called the
                    Redhorn Gate, under the far side of Caradhras, we shall come
                    down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves.
                    There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode
                    rises in its icy springs.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Dark is the water of Kheled-z&#226;ram,&rsquo; said
                    Gimli, &lsquo;and cold are the springs of Kibil-n&#226;la.
                    My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them
                    soon.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf !&rsquo;
                    said Gandalf. &lsquo;But whatever you may do, we at least
                    cannot stay in that valley. We must go down the Silverlode
                    into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and
                    then——&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>He paused.</p>
                <p>&lsquo;Yes, and where then?&rsquo; asked Merry.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;To the end of the journey &#8211; in the end,&rsquo;
                    said Gandalf. &lsquo;We cannot look too far ahead. Let us be
                    glad that the first stage is safely over. I think we will
                    rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a
                    wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country
                    before it wholly forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt
                    there.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said Legolas. &lsquo;But the
                    Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the
                    silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember
                    them. Only I hear the stones lament them:
                    <em
                        >deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they
                        builded us; but they are gone</em
                    >. They are gone. They sought the Havens long ago.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by
                    great bushes of holly, and their supper-breakfast was
                    merrier than it had been since they set out. They did not
                    hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all the
                    night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again
                    until the evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent
                    and restless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the
                    ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out
                    southwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was
                    listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and
                    looked down at the others laughing and talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What is the matter, Strider?&rsquo; Merry called up.
                    &lsquo;What are you looking for? Do you miss the East
                    Wind?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;No indeed,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;But I miss
                    something. I have been in the country of Hollin in many
                    seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other creatures
                    live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things
                    but you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for
                    miles about us, and your voices seem to make the ground
                    echo. I do not understand it.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. &lsquo;But what do
                    you guess is the reason?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Is there
                    more in it than sur- prise at seeing four hobbits, not to
                    mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or
                    heard?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I hope that is it,&rsquo; answered Aragorn.
                    &lsquo;But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of fear, that
                    I have never had here before.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then we must be
                    more careful,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;If you bring a
                    Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him,
                    especially if the Ranger is Aragorn. We must stop talking
                    aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <div class="intersector" data-crows="true">
                    <p>
                        It was Sam&rsquo;s turn that day to take the first
                        watch, but Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep.
                        Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. The
                        breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The
                        swish of the pony&rsquo;s tail and the occasional
                        movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam could hear
                        his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was
                        around him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the
                        Sun rode up from the East. Away in the South a dark
                        patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like ﬂying
                        smoke in the wind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, Strider? It don&rsquo;t look
                        like a cloud,&rsquo; said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn.
                        He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky;
                        but before long Sam could see for himself what was
                        approaching. Flocks of birds, ﬂying at great speed, were
                        wheeling and circling, and traversing all the land as if
                        they were searching for something; and they were
                        steadily drawing nearer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Lie ﬂat and still!&rsquo; hissed Aragorn, pulling
                        Sam down into the shade of a holly-bush; for a whole
                        regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main
                        host, and came, ﬂying low, straight towards the ridge.
                        Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size. As
                        they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their
                        shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one
                        harsh croak was heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and
                        west, and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise.
                        Then he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Regiments of black crows are ﬂying over all the
                        land between the Mountains and the Greyﬂood,&rsquo; he
                        said, &lsquo;and they have passed over Hollin. They are
                        not natives here; they are
                        <em>crebain </em>out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do not
                        know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble
                        away south from which they are ﬂeeing; but I think they
                        are spying out the land. I have also glimpsed many hawks
                        ﬂying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move again
                        this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it
                        is being watched.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf; &lsquo;and how we can get over that without being
                    seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of that when we
                    must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that
                    you are right.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned
                    low before the
                    <em>crebain </em>came,&rsquo; said Aragorn. &lsquo;It must
                    be put out and not lit again.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well if that isn&rsquo;t a plague and a
                    nuisance!&rsquo; said Pippin. The news: no fire, and a move
                    again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke
                    in the late afternoon. &lsquo;All because of a pack of
                    crows! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight:
                    something hot.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, you can go on looking forward,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you.
                    For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and
                    warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any
                    rate: it will get warmer as we get south.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Too warm, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; muttered
                    Sam to Frodo. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m beginning to think
                    it&rsquo;s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain, and
                    saw the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first
                    that this here Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might be
                    it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker
                    dwarf-language must be!&rsquo; Maps conveyed nothing to
                    Sam&rsquo;s mind, and all distances in these strange lands
                    seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds
                    passed over now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red
                    they disappeared southwards. At dusk the Company set out,
                    and turning now half east they steered their course towards
                    Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red in the
                    last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars
                    sprang forth as the sky faded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to
                    Frodo like the remains of an ancient road, that had once
                    been broad and well planned, from Hollin to the
                    mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the
                    mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of
                    stones were black. Many of them looked to have been worked
                    by hands, though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a
                    bleak, barren land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn,
                    and the moon was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly
                    he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as if for
                    a moment they faded and then ﬂashed out again. He shivered.
                    &lsquo;Did you see anything pass over?&rsquo; he whispered
                    to Gandalf, who was just ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;No, but I felt it, whatever it was,&rsquo; he
                    answered. &lsquo;It may be nothing, only a wisp of thin
                    cloud.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It was moving fast then,&rsquo; muttered Aragorn,
                    &lsquo;and not with the wind.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p class="dinkus">* * *</p>
                <p>
                    Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned
                    even brighter than before. But the air was chill again;
                    already the wind was turning back towards the east. For two
                    more nights they marched on, climbing steadily but ever more
                    slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the
                    mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morn-
                    ing Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with
                    snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if
                    stained with blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The
                    wind had gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed
                    the air and looked back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Winter deepens behind us,&rsquo; he said quietly to
                    Aragorn. &lsquo;The heights away north are whiter than they
                    were; snow is lying far down their shoulders. Tonight we
                    shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate. We may
                    well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by
                    some evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy
                    than any. What do you think of your course now,
                    Aragorn?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and
                    Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long
                    before. He listened anxiously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I think no good of our course from beginning to end,
                    as you know well, Gandalf,&rsquo; answered Aragorn.
                    &lsquo;And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on.
                    But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the
                    passage of the moun- tains. Further south there are no
                    passes, till one comes to the Gap of Rohan. I do not trust
                    that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows which side
                    now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Who knows indeed!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But
                    there is another way, and not by the pass of Caradhras: the
                    dark and secret way that we have spoken of.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say
                    nothing to the others, I beg, not until it is plain that
                    there is no other way.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We must decide before we go further,&rsquo; answered
                    Gandalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the
                    others rest and sleep,&rsquo; said Aragorn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their
                    breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood
                    looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen,
                    and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo watched them,
                    wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned
                    to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had
                    been decided to face the weather and the high pass. He was
                    relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and
                    secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill
                    Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been
                    abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;From signs that we have seen lately,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf, &lsquo;I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched;
                    and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up
                    behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we
                    can. Even so it will take us more than two marches before we
                    reach the top of the pass. Dark will come early this
                    evening. We must leave as soon as you can get ready.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I will add a word of advice, if I may,&rsquo; said
                    Boromir. &lsquo;I was born under the shadow of the White
                    Mountains and know something of journeys in the high places.
                    We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down
                    on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret
                    that we are frozen to death. When we leave here, where there
                    are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should carry a
                    faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And Bill could take a bit more, couldn&rsquo;t you,
                    lad?&rsquo; said Sam. The pony looked at him mournfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But we must
                    not use the wood &#8211; not unless it is a choice between
                    fire and death.&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="caradhras1">
                <p>
                    The Company set out again, with good speed at first; but
                    soon their way became steep and difficult. The twisting and
                    climbing road had in many places almost disappeared, and was
                    blocked with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark
                    under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the rocks.
                    By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great
                    mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
                    cliffs to the left, above which the grim ﬂanks of Caradhras
                    towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf
                    of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a
                    moment at the top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He
                    put out his arm and saw the dim white ﬂakes of snow settling
                    on his sleeve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast,
                    filling all the air, and swirling into Frodo&rsquo;s eyes.
                    The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or
                    two ahead could hardly be seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all,&rsquo; panted Sam
                    just behind. &lsquo;Snow&rsquo;s all right on a fine
                    morning, but I like to be in bed while it&rsquo;s falling. I
                    wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome
                    it there.&rsquo; Except on the high moors of the North-
                    farthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was
                    regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living
                    hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of
                    <span>1311</span>, when white wolves invaded the Shire over
                    the frozen Brandywine. Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his
                    hood and shoulders;
                </p>
                <p>it was already ankle-deep about his boots.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;This is what I feared,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What do
                    you say now, Aragorn?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That I feared it too,&rsquo; Aragorn answered,
                    &lsquo;but less than other things. I knew the risk of snow,
                    though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in
                    the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far
                    down, where the paths are usually open all the
                    winter.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I wonder if this is a contrivance of the
                    Enemy,&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;They say in my land that
                    he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that
                    stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and
                    many allies.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;His arm has grown long indeed,&rsquo; said Gimli,
                    &lsquo;if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us
                    here three hundred leagues away.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;His arm has grown long,&rsquo; said Gandalf.</p>

                <p>
                    While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow
                    slackened until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But
                    they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm
                    returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled and the snow
                    became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard
                    to keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along
                    behind the taller folk, but it was plain that they could not
                    go much further, if the snow continued. Frodo&rsquo;s feet
                    felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even Gimli, as
                    stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.
                </p>
                <p data-sound="wind">
                    The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an
                    agreement without any words being spoken. They heard eerie
                    noises in the darkness round them. It may have been only a
                    trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky
                    wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and wild
                    howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the
                    mountain-side, whist- ling over their heads, or crashing on
                    the path beside them. Every now and again they heard a dull
                    rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights
                    above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We cannot go further tonight,&rsquo; said Boromir.
                    &lsquo;Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell
                    voices on the air; and these stones are aimed at us.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I do call it the wind,&rsquo; said Aragorn.
                    &lsquo;But that does not make what you say untrue. There are
                    many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have
                    little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not
                    in league with Sauron, but have purposes of their own. Some
                    have been in this world longer than he.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill
                    name,&rsquo; said Gimli, &lsquo;long years ago, when rumour
                    of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat
                    off his attack,&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But what can we do?&rsquo; cried Pippin miserably. He
                    was leaning on Merry and Frodo, and he was shivering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Either stop where we are, or go back,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf. &lsquo;It is no good going on. Only a little
                    higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the cliff
                    and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long
                    hard slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or
                    stones &#8211; or anything else.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And it is no good going back while the storm
                    holds,&rsquo; said Aragorn. &lsquo;We have passed no place
                    on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall
                    we are under now.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Shelter!&rsquo; muttered Sam. &lsquo;If this is
                    shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as
                    they could. It faced southwards, and near the bottom it
                    leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would give them
                    some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling
                    stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every
                    side, and the snow ﬂowed down in ever denser clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the
                    pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits,
                    and screened them a little; but before long the drifting
                    snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they
                    had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have
                    been entirely buried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking
                    fast into a warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was
                    heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side
                    of the hearth he heard Bilbo&rsquo;s voice speaking.
                    <em>I don&rsquo;t think much of your diary</em>, he said.
                    <em
                        >Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to
                        come back to report that!</em
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo</em>, Frodo answered
                    with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came
                    back pain- fully to wakefulness. Boromir had lifted him off
                    the ground out of a nest of snow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;This will be the death of the halﬂings,
                    Gandalf,&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;It is useless to sit
                    here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do
                    something to save ourselves.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Give them this,&rsquo; said Gandalf, searching in his
                    pack and drawing out a leathern ﬂask. &lsquo;Just a mouthful
                    each &#8211; for all of us. It is very precious. It is
                    <em>miruvor</em>, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to
                    me at our parting. Pass it round!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and
                    fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the
                    heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived and
                    found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did not relent. It
                    whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew
                    louder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What do you say to fire?&rsquo; asked Boromir
                    suddenly. &lsquo;The choice seems near now between fire and
                    death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all
                    unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will
                    not help us.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;You may make a fire, if you can,&rsquo; answered
                    Gandalf. &lsquo;If there are any watchers that can endure
                    this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice
                    of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to
                    strike a ﬂame that would hold amid the swirling wind or
                    catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself
                    took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a
                    moment, and then with a word of command,
                    <em>naur an edraith ammen! </em>he thrust the end of his
                    staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green
                    and blue ﬂame sprang out, and the wood ﬂared and sputtered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed
                    to them,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have written
                    <em>Gandalf is here </em>in signs that all can read from
                    Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly
                    eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the
                    fire. The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the
                    snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they
                    warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood,
                    stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blow- ing
                    ﬂames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces;
                    behind them the night was like a black wall.
                </p>
                <p>But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.</p>

                <p>
                    The fire burned low, and the last faggot was thrown on.
                    &lsquo;The night is getting old,&rsquo; said Aragorn.
                    &lsquo;The dawn is not far off.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If any dawn can pierce these clouds,&rsquo; said
                    Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the
                    blackness. &lsquo;The snow is growing less,&rsquo; he said,
                    &lsquo;and the wind is quieter.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frodo gazed wearily at the ﬂakes still falling out of the
                    dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the
                    dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of
                    their slacken- ing. Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning to
                    creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed
                    fallen, and the ﬂakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very
                    slowly a dim light began to grow. At last the snow stopped
                    altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded
                    world. Below their refuge were white humps and domes and
                    shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden
                    was altogether lost; but the heights above were hidden in
                    great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli looked up and shook his head. &lsquo;Caradhras has not
                    forgiven us,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;He has more snow yet to
                    ﬂing at us, if we go on. The sooner we go back and down the
                    better.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It
                    might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes
                    of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the
                    heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and
                    piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If Gandalf would go before us with a bright ﬂame, he
                    might melt a path for you,&rsquo; said Legolas. The storm
                    had troubled him little, and he alone of the Company
                    remained still light of heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If Elves could ﬂy over mountains, they might fetch
                    the Sun to save us,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;But I
                    must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Boromir, &lsquo;when heads are at a
                    loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country. The
                    strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all is now
                    snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that
                    shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there that the snow
                    first began to burden us. If we could reach that point,
                    maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than a
                    furlong off, I guess.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then let us force a path thither, you and I!&rsquo;
                    said Aragorn. Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but
                    Boromir, little less in height, was broader and heavier in
                    build. He led the way, and Aragorn followed him. Slowly they
                    moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In places the snow
                    was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or
                    burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips,
                    and then he turned to the others. &lsquo;The strongest must
                    seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but
                    choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over
                    grass and leaf, or over snow &#8211; an Elf.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as
                    if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the
                    Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always
                    did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; he said to Gandalf. &lsquo;I go to
                    find the Sun!&rsquo; Then swift as a runner over firm sand
                    he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a
                    wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance,
                    and vanished round the rocky turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir
                    and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At
                    length they too passed from sight. The time dragged on. The
                    clouds lowered, and now a few ﬂakes of snow came curling
                    down again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and
                    then at last they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time
                    Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him
                    and came labouring up the slope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried Legolas as he ran up, &lsquo;I
                    have not brought the Sun. She is walking in the blue fields
                    of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn
                    hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a
                    gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet.
                    There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the
                    turn, and there our Strong Men were almost buried. They
                    despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was
                    little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow
                    suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a
                    white coverlet to cool a hobbit&rsquo;s toes.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Ah, it is as I said,&rsquo; growled Gimli. &lsquo;It
                    was no ordinary storm. It is the ill will of Caradhras. He
                    does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that drift was laid to
                    cut off our escape.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you
                    have Men with you,&rsquo; said Boromir, who came up at that
                    moment. &lsquo;And doughty Men too, if I may say it; though
                    lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still,
                    we have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all
                    here may be grateful who cannot run as light as
                    Elves.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But how are we to get down there, even if you have
                    cut through the drift?&rsquo; said Pippin, voicing the
                    thought of all the hobbits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Have hope!&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;I am weary,
                    but I still have some strength left, and Aragorn too. We
                    will bear the little folk. The others no doubt will make
                    shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I
                    will begin with you.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He lifted up the hobbit. &lsquo;Cling to my back! I shall
                    need my arms,&rsquo; he said and strode forward. Aragorn
                    with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at his strength,
                    seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other
                    tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he
                    was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting the
                    snow aside as he went.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They came at length to the great drift. It was ﬂung across
                    the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its
                    crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than
                    twice the height of Boromir; but through the middle a
                    passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge.
                    On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there
                    they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to
                    arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the
                    narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill
                    with Gimli perched among the baggage. Last came Aragorn
                    carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; but hardly had
                    Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there
                    rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray
                    of it half blinded the Company as they crouched against the
                    cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path
                    was blocked behind them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Enough, enough!&rsquo; cried Gimli. &lsquo;We are
                    departing as quickly as we may!&rsquo; And indeed with that
                    last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be
                    expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders
                    had been beaten off and would not dare to return. The threat
                    of snow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew
                    broader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became
                    steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even the
                    hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood once more on
                    the ﬂat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had
                    felt the first ﬂakes of snow the night before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they
                    looked back westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the
                    tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was
                    the dell from which they had started to climb the pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frodo&rsquo;s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and
                    hungry; and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and
                    painful march downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes.
                    He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the
                    distance below him, but still high above the lower
                    foothills, dark dots were circling in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The birds again!&rsquo; said Aragorn, pointing down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That cannot be helped now,&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;Whether they are good or evil, or have nothing to do
                    with us at all, we must go down at once. Not even on the
                    knees of Caradhras will we wait for another
                    night-fall!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cold wind ﬂowed down behind them, as they turned their
                    backs on the Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the
                    slope. Caradhras had defeated them.
                </p>

                    <span>A JOURNEY IN THE DARK</span>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast,
                    when they halted for the night. They were very weary. The
                    mountains were veiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was
                    cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the
                    <em>miruvor</em> of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food
                    he called a council.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,&rsquo; he
                    said. &lsquo;The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us
                    out, and we must rest here for a while.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;And then where are we to go?&rsquo; asked Frodo.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We still have our journey and our errand before
                    us,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;We have no choice but to
                    go on, or to return to Rivendell.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pippin&rsquo;s face brightened visibly at the mere mention
                    of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully.
                    But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.
                    &lsquo;I wish I was back there,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But
                    how can I return without shame &#8211; unless there is
                    indeed no other way, and we are already defeated?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;You are right, Frodo,&rsquo; said Gandalf: &lsquo;to
                    go back is to admit defeat, and face worse defeat to come.
                    If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall
                    not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell
                    will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will
                    be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they
                    are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would
                    possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master&rsquo;s hand
                    again.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then we must go on, if there is a way,&rsquo; said
                    Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back into gloom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There is a way that we may attempt,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf. &lsquo;I thought from the beginning, when first I
                    considered this jour- ney, that we should try it. But it is
                    not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the
                    Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over
                    the mountains had at least been tried.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it
                    must be evil indeed,&rsquo; said Merry. &lsquo;But you had
                    better tell us about it, and let us know the worst at
                    once.&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="caradhras2">
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of
                    Moria,&rsquo; said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a
                    smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all the others a dread
                    fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it was
                    a legend of vague fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that
                    it will lead through Moria?&rsquo; said Aragorn darkly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It is a name of ill omen,&rsquo; said Boromir.
                    &lsquo;Nor do I see the need to go there. If we cannot cross
                    the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come to
                    the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people,
                    taking the road that I followed on my way hither. Or we
                    might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and
                    Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the
                    sea.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Things have changed since you came north,
                    Boromir,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;Did you not hear
                    what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business of
                    my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near
                    Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented. The Gap of
                    Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We
                    might spend a year in such a journey, and we should pass
                    through many lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they
                    would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of
                    the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you
                    were in the Enemy&rsquo;s eyes only one stray wanderer from
                    the South and a matter of small concern to him: his mind was
                    busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return now as a
                    member of the Ring&rsquo;s Company, and you are in peril as
                    long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with
                    every league that we go south under the naked sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our
                    plight has become more desperate, I fear. I see now little
                    hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, and
                    cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go
                    neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them.
                    That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect
                    us to take.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We do not know what he expects,&rsquo; said Boromir.
                    &lsquo;He may watch all roads, likely and unlikely. In that
                    case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap, hardly
                    better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower itself.
                    The name of Moria is black.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;You speak of what you do not know, when you liken
                    Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,&rsquo; answered Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the
                    Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in Dol
                    Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-d&ucirc;r do not
                    return. But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no
                    hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs there, it may
                    prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs of the
                    Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of
                    Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again
                    from afar; but there is a hope that Moria is still free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and
                    that in some deep hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin
                    may be found. However it may prove, one must tread the path
                    that need chooses!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I will tread the path with you, Gandalf!&rsquo; said
                    Gimli. &lsquo;I will go and look on the halls of Durin,
                    whatever may wait there &#8211; if you can find the doors
                    that are shut.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Good, Gimli!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;You
                    encourage me. We will seek the hidden doors together. And we
                    will come through. In the ruins of the Dwarves, a dwarf
                    &rsquo;s head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or
                    Men or Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I
                    have been to Moria. I sought there long for Thr&#226;in son
                    of Thr&oacute;r after he was lost. I passed through, and I
                    came out again alive!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,&rsquo; said
                    Aragorn quietly; &lsquo;but though I also came out again,
                    the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria a
                    second time.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t wish to enter it even once,&rsquo;
                    said Pippin. &lsquo;Nor me,&rsquo; muttered Sam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Of course not!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;Who would?
                    But the ques- tion is: who will follow me, if I lead you
                    there?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Gimli eagerly.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Aragorn heavily. &lsquo;You
                    followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow, and have
                    said no word of blame. I will follow your lead now &#8211;
                    if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the
                    Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you,
                    Gandalf. And I say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria,
                    beware!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I will <em>not </em>go,&rsquo; said Boromir;
                    &lsquo;not unless the vote of the whole Company is against
                    me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The
                    Ring-bearer&rsquo;s voice surely should be heard?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;I do not wish to go to Moria,&rsquo; said Legolas.</p>
                <p>
                    The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo
                    spoke. &lsquo;I do not wish to go,&rsquo; he said;
                    &lsquo;but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of
                    Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have
                    slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of
                    the morning than in this cold gloom. How the wind
                    howls!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the
                    wind hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a
                    howling and wailing round them in the empty spaces of the
                    night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. &lsquo;How the wind
                    howls!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;It is howling with
                    wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the
                    Mountains!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Need we wait until morning then?&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;It is as I said. The hunt is up! Even if we live to
                    see the dawn, who now will wish to journey south by night
                    with the wild wolves on his trail?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;How far is Moria?&rsquo; asked Boromir.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some
                    fifteen miles as the crow ﬂies, and maybe twenty as the wolf
                    runs,&rsquo; answered Gandalf grimly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if
                    we can,&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;The wolf that one hears
                    is worse than the orc that one fears.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;True!&rsquo; said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its
                    sheath. &lsquo;But where the warg howls, there also the orc
                    prowls.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I wish I had taken Elrond&rsquo;s advice,&rsquo;
                    muttered Pippin to Sam. &lsquo;I am no good after all. There
                    is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer in
                    me: these howls freeze my blood. I don&rsquo;t ever remember
                    feeling so wretched.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;My heart&rsquo;s right down in my toes, Mr.
                    Pippin,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;But we aren&rsquo;t etten
                    yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever
                    may be in store for old Gandalf, I&rsquo;ll wager it
                    isn&rsquo;t a wolf &rsquo;s belly.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the
                    top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering.
                    It was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees, about
                    which lay a broken circle of boulder-stones. In the midst of
                    this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness
                    and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the
                    hunting packs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard
                    dozed uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated
                    where he stood. The howling of the wolves was now all round
                    them, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off. In the
                    dead of night many shining eyes were seen peering over the
                    brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of
                    stones. At a gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could
                    be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from
                    him, as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the
                    assault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff
                    aloft. &lsquo;Listen, Hound of Sauron!&rsquo; he cried.
                    &lsquo;Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! I
                    will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this
                    ring.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap.
                    At that moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed
                    his bow. There was a hideous yell, and the leaping shape
                    thudded to the ground; the Elvish arrow had pierced its
                    throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished.
                    Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was
                    deserted; the hunting packs had ﬂed. All about them the
                    darkness grew silent, and no cry came on the sighing wind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting,
                    gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds. Sud- denly
                    Frodo started from sleep. Without warning a storm of howls
                    broke out fierce and wild all about the camp. A great host
                    of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them
                    from every side at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Fling fuel on the fire!&rsquo; cried Gandalf to the
                    hobbits. &lsquo;Draw your blades, and stand back to
                    back!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw
                    many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and
                    more followed. Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn
                    passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir
                    hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his
                    stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas
                    was singing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow:
                    he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some
                    ancient king of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a
                    cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the
                    wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed
                    the blazing brand. It ﬂared with a sudden white radiance
                    like lightning; and his voice rolled like thunder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;<em>Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!</em
                    >&rsquo; he cried. There was a roar and a crackle, and the
                    tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding ﬂame.
                    The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was
                    crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the
                    defenders shone and ﬂickered. The last arrow of Legolas
                    kindled in the air as it ﬂew, and plunged burning into the
                    heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others ﬂed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash
                    and sparks; a bitter smoke curled above the burned
                    tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the hill, as the first
                    light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were
                    routed and did not return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin?&rsquo; said Sam,
                    sheathing his sword. &lsquo;Wolves won&rsquo;t get him. That
                    was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed the hair
                    off my head!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the full light of the morning came no signs of the
                    wolves were to be found, and they looked in vain for the
                    bodies of the dead. No trace of the fight remained but the
                    charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the
                    hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the
                    point was left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It is as I feared,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;These
                    were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness.
                    Let us eat quickly and go!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at
                    the command of some power that had no longer any use for
                    snow, since they had retreated from the pass, a power that
                    wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved
                    in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been
                    turning through north to north-west during the night, and
                    now it failed. The clouds vanished southwards and the sky
                    was opened, high and blue. As they stood upon the hillside,
                    ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the
                    mountain-tops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We must reach the doors before sunset,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf, &lsquo;or I fear we shall not reach them at all. It
                    is not far, but our path may be winding, for here Aragorn
                    cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and
                    only once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that
                    was long ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There it lies,&rsquo; he said, pointing away
                    south-eastwards to where the mountains&rsquo; sides fell
                    sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance could
                    be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst,
                    taller than the rest, one great grey wall. &lsquo;When we
                    left the pass I led you southwards, and not back to our
                    starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is well
                    that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross,
                    and haste is needed. Let us go!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I do not know which to hope,&rsquo; said Boromir
                    grimly: &lsquo;that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that
                    coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever.
                    All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and
                    the wall the likeliest chance. Lead on!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard&rsquo;s side, so eager
                    was he to come to Moria. Together they led the Company back
                    towards the mountains. The only road of old to Moria from
                    the west had lain along the course of a stream, the
                    Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
                    where the doors had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or
                    else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not
                    strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few
                    miles southwards from their start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Com-
                    pany wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red
                    stones. Nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear
                    any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts sank.
                    They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but
                    what the night would bring, if it caught them in that lost
                    land, none of them cared to think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to
                    them. He was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right.
                    Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow chan- nel.
                    It was empty and silent, and hardly a trickle of water ﬂowed
                    among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed; but on
                    the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed,
                    that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones
                    of an ancient highroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Ah! Here it is at last!&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the
                    Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to
                    the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy.
                    Come! We must hurry on. We are late.&rsquo;
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged
                    doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles.
                    The sun turned from the noon and began to go west. After a
                    brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. Before them
                    the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough
                    of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the
                    far eastward peaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which
                    had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel
                    and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went
                    due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a
                    low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and jagged
                    top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft
                    that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once
                    been strong and full.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Indeed things have changed!&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;But there is no mistaking the place. There is all
                    that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember right, there
                    was a ﬂight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the
                    main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up
                    to the level ground at the top. There used to be a shallow
                    valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria, and
                    the Sirannon ﬂowed through it with the road beside it. Let
                    us go and see what things are like now!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli
                    sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When
                    they reached the top they saw that they could go no further
                    that way, and the reason for the drying up of the
                    Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled
                    the cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them
                    stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was
                    reﬂected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed
                    and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were
                    reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading
                    light: final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance,
                    not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning
                    stone.

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="wallsOfMoria">
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There are the Walls of Moria,&rsquo; said Gandalf,
                    pointing across the water. &lsquo;And there the Gate stood
                    once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end of the road from
                    Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None
                    of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water
                    at the end of the day. It has an unwholesome look.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We must find a way round the northern edge,&rsquo;
                    said Gimli. &lsquo;The first thing for the Company to do is
                    to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead
                    us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our
                    baggage-pony up this stair.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into
                    the Mines,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;The road under the
                    mountains is a dark road, and there are places narrow and
                    steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Poor old Bill!&rsquo; said Frodo. &lsquo;I had not
                    thought of that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will
                    say?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;Poor Bill has
                    been a useful companion, and it goes to my heart to turn him
                    adrift now. I would have travelled lighter and brought no
                    animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had
                    had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to
                    take this road.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting
                    in the sky high above the sunset, when the Company, with all
                    the speed they could, climbed up the slopes and reached the
                    side of the lake. In breadth it looked to be no more than
                    two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it
                    stretched away southward they could not see in the failing
                    light; but its northern end was no more than half a mile
                    from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that
                    enclosed the valley and the water&rsquo;s edge there was a
                    rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still
                    a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the
                    far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still
                    to find the doors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they
                    found a narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and
                    stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclos-
                    ing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, and found that
                    the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at the edge.
                    Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with
                    care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy
                    stones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with
                    disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry
                    ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish,
                    followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still
                    surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw ripples,
                    black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings
                    were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake.
                    There was a bub- bling noise, and then silence. The dusk
                    deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in
                    cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others
                    followed as quickly as they could. They reached the strip of
                    dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow,
                    often hardly a dozen yards across, and encumbered with
                    fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the
                    cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might.
                    A mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly
                    trees. Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows,
                    the remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that
                    had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close
                    under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, two
                    tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had
                    ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread from the
                    wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked
                    like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the
                    Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and
                    silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet,
                    standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, here we are at last!&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;Here the Elven- way from Hollin ended. Holly was the
                    token of the people of that land, and they planted it here
                    to mark the end of their domain; for the West-door was made
                    chieﬂy for their use in their traffic with the Lords of
                    Moria. Those were happier days, when there was still close
                    friendship at times between folk of different race, even
                    between Dwarves and Elves.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the
                    friendship waned,&rsquo; said Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I have not heard that it was the fault of the
                    Elves,&rsquo; said Legolas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I have heard both,&rsquo; said Gandalf; &lsquo;and I
                    will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and
                    Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help me. I need you
                    both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find
                    them the better. Night is at hand!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turning to the others he said: &lsquo;While I am searching,
                    will you each make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear
                    we must say farewell to our good beast of burden. You must
                    lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter
                    weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we
                    come through and journey on down into the South. Instead
                    each of us must take a share of what the pony carried,
                    especially the food and the water-skins.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t leave poor old Bill behind in
                    this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf!&rsquo; cried Sam, angry
                    and distressed. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have it, and
                    that&rsquo;s ﬂat. After he has come so far and all!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I am sorry, Sam,&rsquo; said the wizard. &lsquo;But
                    when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to drag
                    your Bill inside, into the long dark of Moria. You will have
                    to choose between Bill and your master.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;He&rsquo;d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon&rsquo;s
                    den, if I led him,&rsquo; protested Sam. &lsquo;It&rsquo;d
                    be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these
                    wolves about.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It will be short of murder, I hope,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf. He laid his hand on the pony&rsquo;s head, and
                    spoke in a low voice. &lsquo;Go with words of guard and
                    guiding on you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You are a wise beast,
                    and have learned much in Rivendell. Make your ways to places
                    where you can find grass, and so come in time to
                    Elrond&rsquo;s house, or wherever you wish to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of
                    escap- ing wolves and getting home as we have.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill,
                    seeming to understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to
                    him, putting his nose to Sam&rsquo;s ear. Sam burst into
                    tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all the
                    pony&rsquo;s packs and throwing them on the ground. The
                    others sorted out the goods, making a pile of all that could
                    be left behind, and dividing up the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared
                    to have done nothing. He was standing between the two trees
                    gazing at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he would bore a
                    hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was wandering about,
                    tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was
                    pressed against the rock, as if listening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, here we are and all ready,&rsquo; said Merry;
                    &lsquo;but where are the Doors? I can&rsquo;t see any sign
                    of them.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,&rsquo;
                    said Gimli. &lsquo;They are invisible, and their own makers
                    cannot find them or open them, if their secret is
                    forgotten.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But this Door was not made to be a secret known only
                    to Dwarves,&rsquo; said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and
                    turning round. &lsquo;Unless things are altogether changed,
                    eyes that know what to look for may discover the
                    signs.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of
                    the trees there was a smooth space, and over this he passed
                    his hands to and fro, muttering words under his breath. Then
                    he stepped back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Can you see anything
                    now?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they
                    could see nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the
                    surface, where the wizard&rsquo;s hands had passed, faint
                    lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running in the
                    stone. At first they were no more than pale
                    gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully
                    where the Moon caught them, but steadily they grew broader
                    and clearer, until their design could be guessed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of
                    interlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though
                    the threads were in places blurred or broken, the outline
                    could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown
                    with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, each
                    bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there
                    shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with
                    many rays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There are the emblems of Durin!&rsquo; cried Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And there is the Tree of the High Elves!&rsquo; said
                    Legolas. &lsquo;And the Star of the House of Fe¨anor,&rsquo;
                    said Gandalf. &lsquo;They are wrought of
                    <em>ithildin </em>that mirrors only starlight and moon-
                    light, and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks
                    words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is long since I
                    heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them
                    to my mind.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What does the writing say?&rsquo; asked Frodo, who
                    was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch. &lsquo;I
                    thought I knew the elf-letters, but I cannot read
                    these.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of
                    Middle- earth in the Elder Days,&rsquo; answered Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;But they do not say anything of importance to us.
                    They say only:
                    <em
                        >The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and
                        enter. </em
                    >And underneath small and faint is written:
                    <em
                        >I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these
                        signs.</em
                    >&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What does it mean by
                    <em>speak, friend, and enter</em>?&rsquo; asked Merry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That is plain enough,&rsquo; said Gimli. &lsquo;If
                    you are a friend, speak the password, and the doors will
                    open, and you can enter.&rsquo;
                </p>

                <div class="imgLayout">

                </div>

                <p>
                    &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Gandalf, &lsquo;these doors are
                    probably governed by words. Some dwarf-gates will open only
                    at special times, or open for particular persons; and some
                    have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary
                    times and words are known. These doors have no key. In the
                    days of Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open
                    and doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew
                    the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it
                    is recorded, is it not, Gimli?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is,&rsquo;
                    said the dwarf. &lsquo;But what the word was is not
                    remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have
                    vanished from the earth.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;But do not <em>you </em>know the word,
                    Gandalf?&rsquo; asked Boromir in surprise.
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the wizard.</p>
                <p>
                    The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf
                    well, remained silent and unmoved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed
                    spot?&rsquo; cried Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at
                    the dark water. &lsquo;You told us that you had once passed
                    through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not know
                    how to enter?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The answer to your first question, Boromir,&rsquo;
                    said the wiz- ard, &lsquo;is that I do not know the word
                    &#8211; yet. But we shall soon see. And,&rsquo; he added,
                    with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows,
                    &lsquo;you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are
                    proved useless. As for your other question: do you doubt my
                    tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I
                    came from the East.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors
                    open outwards. From the inside you may thrust them open with
                    your hands. From the outside nothing will move them save the
                    spell of command. They cannot be forced inwards.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What are you going to do then?&rsquo; asked Pippin,
                    undaunted by the wizard&rsquo;s bristling brows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin
                    Took,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But if that does not
                    shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish
                    questions, I will seek for the opening words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves
                    or Men or Orcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can
                    still remember ten score of them without searching in my
                    mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be needed; and I
                    shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret
                    dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were
                    Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that seems
                    certain.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with
                    his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of
                    the anvil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth
                    lammen! he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines
                    faded, but the blank grey stone did not stir.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many times he repeated these words in different order, or
                    varied them. Then he tried other spells, one after another,
                    speaking now faster and louder, now soft and slow. Then he
                    spoke many single words of Elvish speech. Nothing hap-
                    pened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars
                    were kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms
                    he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath.
                    <em>Edro, edro! </em>he cried, and struck the rock with his
                    staff. <em>Open, open! </em>he shouted, and followed it with
                    the same command in every language that had ever been spoken
                    in the West of Middle- earth. Then he threw his staff on the
                    ground, and sat down in silence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening
                    ears the howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear,
                    and Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Do not let him run away!&rsquo; said Boromir.
                    &lsquo;It seems that we shall need him still, if the wolves
                    do not find us. How I hate this foul pool!&rsquo; He stooped
                    and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark
                    water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant
                    there was a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed
                    on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen, and
                    they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Why did you do that, Boromir?&rsquo; said Frodo.
                    &lsquo;I hate this place, too, and I am afraid. I
                    don&rsquo;t know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind
                    the doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool.
                    Don&rsquo;t disturb it!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;I wish we could get away!&rsquo; said Merry.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Gandalf do something quick?&rsquo;
                    said Pippin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed,
                    either in despair or in anxious thought. The mournful
                    howling of the wolves was heard again. The ripples on the
                    water grew and came closer; some were already lapping on the
                    shore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang
                    to his feet. He was laughing! &lsquo;I have it!&rsquo; he
                    cried. &lsquo;Of course, of course! Absurdly simple, like
                    most riddles when you see the answer.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a
                    clear voice:
                    <em>Mellon!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The star shone out brieﬂy and faded again. Then silently a
                    great doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had
                    been visible before. Slowly it divided in the middle and
                    swung outwards inch by inch, until both doors lay back
                    against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could
                    be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the
                    darkness was deeper than the night. The Company stared in
                    wonder. &lsquo;I was wrong after all,&rsquo; said Gandalf,
                    &lsquo;and Gimli too. Merry, of all people, was on the right
                    track. The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
                    time! The translation should have been:
                    <em>Say &lsquo;&lsquo;Friend&rsquo;&rsquo; and enter</em>. I
                    had only to speak the Elvish word for <em>friend </em>and
                    the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned
                    lore-master in these suspicious days.
                </p>
                <p>Those were happier times. Now let us go!&rsquo;</p>

                <p>
                    He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But
                    at that moment several things happened. Frodo felt something
                    seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a cry. Bill the
                    pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed
                    away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after
                    him, and then hearing Frodo&rsquo;s cry he ran back again,
                    weeping and cursing. The others swung round and saw the
                    waters of the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were
                    swimming up from the southern end.

                <p>
                    Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it
                    was pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had
                    hold of Frodo&rsquo;s foot, and was dragging him into the
                    water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out
                    for help. Twenty other arms came rippling out. The dark
                    water boiled, and there was a hideous stench.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick!&rsquo;
                    shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from the horror
                    that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where
                    they stood, he drove them forward.

                    They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps
                    up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping
                    tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the
                    cliff-wall and the doors. One came wriggling over the
                    threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned and
                    paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate
                    again from within, there was no need. Many coiling arms
                    seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength,
                    swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed, and
                    all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came
                    dully through the ponderous stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam, clinging to Frodo&rsquo;s arm, collapsed on a step in
                    the black darkness. &lsquo;Poor old Bill!&rsquo; he said in
                    a choking voice. &lsquo;Poor old Bill! Wolves and snakes!
                    But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, Mr.
                    Frodo. I had to come with you.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his
                    staff against the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and
                    the stairs trembled, but the doors did not open.

                <p class="dinkus">* * *</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said the wizard. &lsquo;The
                    passage is blocked behind us now, and there is only one way
                    out &#8211; on the other side of the mountains. I fear from
                    the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees
                    uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the
                    trees were beautiful, and had stood so long.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I felt that something horrible was near from the
                    moment that my foot first touched the water,&rsquo; said
                    Frodo. &lsquo;What was the thing, or were there many of
                    them?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; answered Gandalf; &lsquo;but
                    the arms were all guided by one purpose. Something has
                    crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under the
                    mountains. There are older and fouler things than Orcs in
                    the deep places of the world.&rsquo; He did not speak aloud
                    his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it
                    had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone
                    magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear:
                    &lsquo;In the deep places of the world! And thither we are
                    going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly
                    dark?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Gandalf, &lsquo;and
                    Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff !&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="westGate2">
                <p>
                    As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held
                    his staff aloft, and from its tip there came a faint
                    radiance. The wide stairway was sound and undamaged. Two
                    hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the
                    top they found an arched passage with a level ﬂoor leading
                    on into the dark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here
                    on the landing, since we can&rsquo;t find a
                    dining-room!&rsquo; said Frodo. He had begun to shake off
                    the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt
                    extremely hungry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the
                    upper steps, dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten,
                    Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the
                    <em>miruvor </em>of Rivendell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It will not last much longer, I am afraid,&rsquo; he
                    said; &lsquo;but I think we need it after that horror at the
                    gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that
                    is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the
                    water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines,
                    but they should not be touched. We may not have a chance of
                    filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill
                    Dale.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;How long is that going to take us?&rsquo; asked
                    Frodo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I cannot say,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;It
                    depends on many chances. But going straight, without mishap
                    or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I
                    expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to
                    East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind
                    much.&rsquo;
                </p>

                <p>
                    After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All
                    were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible,
                    and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching
                    still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before.
                    In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light
                    of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his
                    right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli,
                    his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head
                    from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had
                    drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades
                    of Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for
                    being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these
                    swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at
                    hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the
                    young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim
                    and silent, walked Aragorn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to
                    descend. It went steadily down for a long while before it
                    became level once again. The air grew hot and stiﬂing, but
                    it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler
                    air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in
                    the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the
                    wizard&rsquo;s staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and
                    arches, and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or
                    running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either
                    side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout
                    courage. At least he was not, as were most of the others,
                    troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard
                    consulted him at points where the choice of way was
                    doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word.
                    The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the
                    imagination of Gimli, Gl&#243;in&rsquo;s son, dwarf of the
                    mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories
                    of a journey long before were now of little help, but even
                    in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew
                    whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as
                    there was a path that led towards his goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Do not be afraid!&rsquo; said Aragorn. There was a
                    pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were
                    whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting
                    anxiously. &lsquo;Do not be afraid! I have been with him on
                    many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales
                    in Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have
                    seen. He will not go astray &#8211; if there is any path to
                    find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he will
                    lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer
                    of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of
                    Queen Ber&#250;thiel.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They
                    had no fuel nor any means of making torches; in the
                    desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left
                    behind. But without any light they would soon have come to
                    grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there
                    were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells
                    beside the path in which their passing feet echoed. There
                    were fissures and chasms in the walls and ﬂoor, and every
                    now and then a crack would open right before their feet. The
                    widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long
                    before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the
                    dreadful gap. The noise of churning water came up from far
                    below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the
                    depths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Rope!&rsquo; muttered Sam. &lsquo;I knew I&rsquo;d
                    want it, if I hadn&rsquo;t got it!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    As these dangers became more frequent their march became
                    slower. Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on,
                    endlessly to the mountains&rsquo; roots. They were more than
                    weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of
                    halting anywhere. Frodo&rsquo;s spirits had risen for a
                    while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the
                    cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept
                    over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of
                    the knife- stroke, that grim wound had not been without
                    effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things
                    that could not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had
                    noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of
                    his com- panions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any
                    case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against
                    his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt
                    the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he
                    said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword
                    and went on doggedly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in
                    hurried whispers. There was no sound but the sound of their
                    own feet: the dull stump of Gimli&rsquo;s dwarf-boots; the
                    heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft,
                    scarce- heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the
                    slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When
                    they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless
                    it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen
                    water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard,
                    something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It
                    was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel
                    certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never
                    stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not an
                    echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all
                    by itself, and then grew still.

                    It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They
                    had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when
                    Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a
                    wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the
                    same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand pass-
                    age plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the
                    middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very
                    narrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I have no memory of this place at all!&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf, stand- ing uncertainly under the arch. He held up
                    his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription
                    that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to
                    be seen. &lsquo;I am too weary to decide,&rsquo; he said,
                    shaking his head. &lsquo;And I expect that you are all as
                    weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt here for what
                    is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is
                    ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and
                    the middle-night has passed.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Poor old Bill!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I wonder where
                    he is. I hope those wolves haven&rsquo;t got him yet.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it
                    was half closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust.
                    Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Steady! Steady!&rsquo; cried Gandalf, as Merry and
                    Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could
                    rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open
                    passage. &lsquo;Steady! You do not know what is inside yet.
                    I will go first.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind.
                    &lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said, pointing with his staff to the
                    middle of the ﬂoor. Before his feet they saw a large round
                    hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay
                    at the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments
                    of stone lay near.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;One of you might have fallen in and still be
                    wondering when you were going to strike the bottom,&rsquo;
                    said Aragorn to Merry. &lsquo;Let the guide go first while
                    you have one.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the
                    watching of the three passages,&rsquo; said Gimli.
                    &lsquo;That hole was plainly a well for the guards&rsquo;
                    use, covered with a stone lid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the
                    dark.&rsquo; Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well.
                    While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds
                    against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from
                    the hole in the ﬂoor, he crept to the edge and peered over.
                    A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible
                    depths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose
                    stone, and let it drop. He felt his heart beat many times
                    before there was any sound. Then far below, as if the stone
                    had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there
                    came a <em>plunk</em>, very distant, but magnified and
                    repeated in the hollow shaft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried Gandalf. He was
                    relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; but he was
                    angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting. &lsquo;Fool of
                    a Took!&rsquo; he growled. &lsquo;This is a serious journey,
                    not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and
                    then you will be no further nuis- ance. Now be quiet!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there
                    came out of the depths faint knocks: <em>tom-tap</em>,
                    <em>tap-tom</em>. They stopped, and when the echoes had died
                    away, they were repeated: <em>tap-tom</em>,
                    <em>tom-tap</em>, <em>tap-tap</em>, <em>tom</em>. They
                    sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a
                    while the knocking died away and was not heard again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard
                    one,&rsquo; said Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Gandalf, &lsquo;and I do not like
                    it. It may have nothing to do with Peregrin&rsquo;s foolish
                    stone; but probably something has been disturbed that would
                    have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind
                    again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further
                    trouble. You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a
                    reward,&rsquo; he growled, as he rolled himself in a
                    blanket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he
                    kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would
                    crawl up out of the well. He wished he could cover the hole,
                    if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it,
                    even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent.
                    He was deep in thought, trying to recall every memory of his
                    former journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the
                    next course that he should take; a false turn now might be
                    disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over to
                    Pippin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,&rsquo; he
                    said in a kindly tone. &lsquo;You want to sleep, I expect. I
                    cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the watching.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I know what is the matter with me,&rsquo; he
                    muttered, as he sat down by the door. &lsquo;I need smoke! I
                    have not tasted it since the morning before the
                    snowstorm.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a
                    dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the ﬂoor,
                    shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his
                    knees. The ﬂicker for a moment showed his sharp nose, and
                    the puff of smoke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat
                    and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the
                    others rest. &lsquo;And in the watches I have made up my
                    mind,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I do not like the feel of the
                    middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand
                    way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall
                    take the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up
                    again.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they
                    marched on; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and
                    saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard&rsquo;s light,
                    bobbing like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp in front of them. The
                    passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as
                    they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it
                    rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings
                    to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the ﬂoor
                    was level and sound, without pits or cracks. Evidently they
                    had struck what once had been an important road; and they
                    went forward quicker than they had done on their first
                    march.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a
                    direct line east, though they must have actually walked
                    twenty miles or more. As the road climbed upwards,
                    Frodo&rsquo;s spirits rose a little; but he still felt
                    oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard,
                    away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of
                    their feet, a following foot- step that was not an echo.

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="hall1">
                <p>
                    They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without
                    a rest, and all were thinking of a place where they could
                    sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left van- ished.
                    They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
                    a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer
                    air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on
                    their faces. They halted and crowded anxiously together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf seemed pleased. &lsquo;I chose the right way,&rsquo;
                    he said. &lsquo;At last we are coming to the habitable
                    parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern
                    side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the
                    Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the
                    air we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real
                    light.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was a
                    blaze like a ﬂash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and
                    ﬂed, and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their
                    heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before
                    them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its
                    black walls, polished and smooth as glass, ﬂashed and
                    glittered. Three other entrances they saw, dark black
                    arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on
                    either side. Then the light went out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;That is all that I shall venture on for the
                    present,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;There used to be great
                    windows on the mountain- side, and shafts leading out to the
                    light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have
                    reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we
                    cannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may
                    actually see the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile we
                    had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things
                    have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road
                    is over. But we are not through yet, and it is a long way
                    down to the Gates that open on the world.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall,
                    huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught:
                    there seemed to be a steady inﬂow of chill air through the
                    eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung the dark-
                    ness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the
                    loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly
                    branching stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that
                    dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell
                    altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
                    at one time,&rsquo; said Sam; &lsquo;and every one of them
                    busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this,
                    and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They
                    didn&rsquo;t live in these darksome holes surely?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;These are not holes,&rsquo; said Gimli. &lsquo;This
                    is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf. And of old
                    it was not darksome, but full of light and splendour, as is
                    still remembered in our songs.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep
                    voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof.

                        Unwearied then were Durin&rsquo;s folk;<br />
                        Beneath the mountains music woke:<br />
                        The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,<br />
                        And at the gates the trumpets rang.<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The world is grey, the mountains old,<br />
                        The forge&rsquo;s fire is ashen-cold;<br />
                        No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:<br />
                        The darkness dwells in Durin&rsquo;s halls;<br />
                        The shadow lies upon his tomb<br />
                        In Moria, in Khazad-d&#251;m.<br />
                        But still the sunken stars appear<br />
                        In dark and windless Mirrormere;<br />
                        There lies his crown in water deep,<br />
                        Till Durin wakes again from sleep.<br />

                    &lsquo;I like that!&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I should like to
                    learn it. <em>In Moria, in Khazad-d&#251;m! </em>But it
                    makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those
                    lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here
                    still?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Piles of jewels?&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;No. The
                    Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left in
                    the upper halls. And since the dwarves ﬂed, no one dares to
                    seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they
                    are drowned in water &#8211; or in a shadow of fear.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Then what do the dwarves want to come back
                    for?&rsquo; asked Sam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;For <em>mithril</em>,&rsquo; answered Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the
                    toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things
                    they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did
                    not need to delve for them: all things that they desired
                    they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in the world
                    was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called
                    it: <em>mithril </em>is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a
                    name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of
                    gold, and now it is beyond price; for little is left above
                    ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The
                    lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to
                    darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale; but even as
                    <em>mithril </em>was the foundation of their wealth, so also
                    it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too
                    deep, and disturbed that from which they ﬂed, Durin&rsquo;s
                    Bane. Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered
                    nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;<em>Mithril! </em>All folk desired it. It could be
                    beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves
                    could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered
                    steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the
                    beauty of <em>mithril </em>did not tarnish or grow dim. The
                    Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it
                    <em>ithildin</em>, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors.
                    Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I
                    wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel
                    Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Gimli, startled out of his
                    silence. &lsquo;A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly
                    gift!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;I never told him,
                    but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire
                    and everything in it.&rsquo; Frodo said nothing, but he put
                    his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his
                    mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been
                    walking about with the price of the Shire under his jacket.
                    Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite
                    well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had
                    been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to
                    Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still
                    there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there,
                    and in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering among the
                    ﬂowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, or mithril
                    <span>&#8211; or the Ring.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep.
                    Frodo was on guard. As if it were a breath that came in
                    through unseen doors out of deep places, dread came over
                    him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He listened. All
                    his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two
                    slow hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined
                    echo of a footfall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed
                    that the western archway stood, he fancied that he could see
                    two pale points of light, almost like luminous eyes. He
                    started. His head had nodded. &lsquo;I must have nearly
                    fallen asleep on guard,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I was on
                    the edge of a dream.&rsquo; He stood up and rubbed his eyes,
                    and remained standing, peering into the dark, until he was
                    relieved by Legolas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to
                    him that the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the
                    two pale points of light approaching, slowly. He woke and
                    found that the others were speaking softly near him, and
                    that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the
                    eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long
                    pale gleam; and across the hall through the northern arch
                    light also glimmered faint and distantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frodo sat up. &lsquo;Good morning!&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;For morning it is again at last. I was right, you
                    see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. Before today
                    is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters
                    of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I shall be glad,&rsquo; said Gimli. &lsquo;I have
                    looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become
                    dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred.
                    I doubt now that Balin ever came here.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at
                    once. &lsquo;We are tired, but we shall rest better when we
                    are outside,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I think that none of us
                    will wish to spend another night in Moria.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;No indeed!&rsquo; said Boromir. &lsquo;Which way
                    shall we take?
                </p>
                <p>Yonder eastward arch?&rsquo;</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But I do not know
                    yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess
                    that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and
                    it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The
                    eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must
                    take; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about
                    us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If we
                    could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light
                    comes only down deep shafts.&rsquo;

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="chamber">
                <p>
                    Following his lead the Company passed under the northern
                    arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went
                    along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it
                    came through a doorway on their right. It was high and
                    ﬂat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges,
                    standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It
                    was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in
                    the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as
                    they entered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the ﬂoor, and stumbled
                    among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could
                    not at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft
                    high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and,
                    far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be seen.
                    The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the
                    middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two feet
                    high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It looks like a tomb,&rsquo; muttered Frodo, and bent
                    forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more
                    closely at it. Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab
                    runes were deeply graven:

                    &lsquo;These are Daeron&rsquo;s Runes, such as were used of
                    old in Moria,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;Here is written in

                    &lsquo;He is dead then,&rsquo; said Frodo. &lsquo;I feared

                    <span>THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-D&#219;M</span>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of
                    Balin. Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with
                    the dwarf, and of Balin&rsquo;s visit to the Shire long ago.
                    In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand
                    years ago and on the other side of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search
                    for anything that would give them tidings of Balin&rsquo;s
                    fate, or show what had become of his folk. There was another
                    smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under the
                    shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones
                    were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads,
                    and cloven shields and helms. Some of the swords were
                    crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and
                    in them were large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been
                    broken and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one
                    there lay the remains of a book. It had been slashed and
                    stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black
                    and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could
                    be read. Gandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves cracked
                    and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for
                    some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli stand- ing at
                    his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that
                    they were written by many different hands, in runes, both of
                    Moria and of Dale, and here and there in Elvish script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last Gandalf looked up. &lsquo;It seems to be a record of
                    the fortunes of Balin&rsquo;s folk,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I
                    guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh
                    on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers
                    referring to the years after their arrival. The top page is
                    marked
                    <em>one &#8211; three</em>, so at least two are missing from
                    the beginning. Listen to this!
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;<em
                        >We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard </em
                    >&#8211; I think; the next word is blurred and burned:
                    probably
                    <em>room &#8211; we slew many in the bright </em>&#8211; I

                        slew the great</em
                    >. Then there is a blur followed by
                    <em>Fl&#243;i under grass near Mirror mere</em>. The next
                    line or two I cannot read. Then comes
                    <em
                        >We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to
                        dwell in. There is </em
                    >I cannot read what. A <em>shaft </em>is mentioned. Then
                    <em
                        >Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of

                    >&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;The Chamber of Records,&rsquo; said Gimli. &lsquo;I
                    guess that is where we now stand.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, I can read no more for a long way,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf, &lsquo;except the word
                    <em>gold</em>, and <em>Durin&rsquo;s Axe </em>and something
                    <em>helm</em>. Then <em>Balin is now lord of Moria</em>.
                    That seems to end a chapter. After some stars another hand
                    begins, and I can see <em>we found truesilver</em>, and
                    later the word <em>wellforged</em>, and then something,
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have it! <em>mithril</em>; and the last two lines
                    <em
                        >&#211;in toto seek for the upper armouries of Third
                        Deep</em
                    >, something <em>go westwards</em>, a blur,
                    <em>to Hollin gate</em>.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. &lsquo;There are
                    several pages of the same sort, rather hastily written and
                    much damaged,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I can make little
                    of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves
                    missing, because they begin to be numbered <em>five</em>,
                    the fifth year of the colony, I suppose. Let me see! No,
                    they are too cut and stained; I cannot read them. We might
                    do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large
                    bold hand using an Elvish script.&rsquo; &lsquo;That would
                    be Ori&rsquo;s hand,&rsquo; said Gimli, looking over the
                    wizard&rsquo;s arm. &lsquo;He could write well and speedily,
                    and often used the Elvish characters.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair
                    hand,&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;The first clear word is
                    <em>sorrow</em>, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it
                    ends in <em>estre</em>. Yes, it must be
                    <em>yestre </em>followed by
                    <em
                        >day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria
                        fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in Mirror

                        orc, but many more . . . up from east up the
                        Silverlode.</em
                    >
                    The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly
                    make anything out, but I think I can read
                    <em>we have barred the gates</em>, and then
                    <em>can hold them long if</em>, and then perhaps
                    <em>horrible and suffer</em>. Poor Balin! He seems to have
                    kept the title that he took for less than five years. I
                    wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no time to
                    puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of
                    all.&rsquo; He paused and sighed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It is grim reading,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I fear
                    their end was cruel. Listen!
                    <em
                        >We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken
                        the Bridge and second hall. Fr&#225;r and L&#243;ni and
                        N&#225;li fell there.</em
                    >
                    Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read
                    went
                    <em>5 days ago</em>. The last lines run
                    <em
                        >the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in
                        the Water took &#211;in. We cannot get out. The end
                        comes</em
                    >, and then <em>drums, drums in the deep</em>. I wonder what
                    that means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl
                    of elf-letters: <em>they are coming</em>. There is nothing
                    more.&rsquo; Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the
                    Company. &lsquo;<em>We cannot get out</em>,&rsquo; muttered
                    Gimli. &lsquo;It was well for us that the pool had sunk a
                    little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the
                    southern end.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gandalf raised his head and looked round. &lsquo;They seem
                    to have made a last stand by both doors,&rsquo; he said;
                    &lsquo;but there were not many left by that time. So ended
                    the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The
                    time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to
                    Balin son of Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his
                    fathers. We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul, and
                    look at it more closely later. You had better keep it,
                    Gimli, and take it back to D&#225;in, if you get a chance.
                    It will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply.
                    Come, let us go! The morning is passing.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;Which way shall we go?&rsquo; asked Boromir.</p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Back to the hall,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;But
                    our visit to this room has not been in vain. I now know
                    where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the Chamber of
                    Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the
                    North-end. Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of
                    the hall, and bear right and south, and go downwards. The
                    Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh Level, that is
                    six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the
                    hall!&rsquo;
                </p>

                <p data-sound="drums">
                    Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a
                    great noise: a rolling <em>Boom </em>that seemed to come
                    from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their
                    feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. <em>Doom</em>,
                    <em>doom </em>it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning
                    the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came
                    an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the hall, and
                    answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off.
                    There was a hurrying sound of many feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;They are coming!&rsquo; cried Legolas. &lsquo;We
                    cannot get out,&rsquo; said Gimli.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Trapped!&rsquo; cried Gandalf. &lsquo;Why did I
                    delay? Here we are, caught, just as they were before. But I
                    was not here then. We will see what——&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Doom, doom</em> came the drum-beat and the walls shook.
                    &lsquo;Slam the doors and wedge them!&rsquo; shouted
                    Aragorn. &lsquo;And keep your packs on as long as you can:
                    we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;We must not get shut
                    in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go that way, if we get
                    a chance.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were
                    coming down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as
                    the Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale
                    light, and Sting glinted at the edges. Boromir set his
                    shoulder against the western door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Wait a moment! Do not close it yet!&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf. He sprang forward to Boromir&rsquo;s side and drew
                    himself up to his full height.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of
                    Moria?&rsquo; he cried in a loud voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of
                    sliding stones into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was
                    raised in command. <em>Doom</em>, <em>boom</em>,
                    <em>doom </em>went the drums in the deep. With a quick
                    movement Gandalf stepped before the nar- row opening of the
                    door and thrust forward his staff. There was a dazzling ﬂash
                    that lit the chamber and the passage outside. For an instant
                    the wizard looked out. Arrows whined and whistled down the
                    corridor as he sprang back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There are Orcs, very many of them,&rsquo; he said.
                    &lsquo;And some are large and evil: black Uruks of Mordor.
                    For the moment they are hanging back, but there is something
                    else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one.
                    There is no hope of escape that way.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as
                    well,&rsquo; said Boromir.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There is no sound outside here yet,&rsquo; said
                    Aragorn, who was standing by the eastern door listening.
                    &lsquo;The passage on this side plunges straight down a
                    stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But
                    it is no good ﬂying blindly this way with the pursuit just
                    behind. We cannot block the door. Its key is gone and the
                    lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do something
                    to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber
                    of Mazarbul!&rsquo; he said grimly, feeling the edge of his
                    sword, And&ucirc;ril.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir ﬂung him-
                    self against the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it
                    with broken sword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company
                    retreated to the other side of the chamber. But they had no
                    chance to ﬂy yet. There was a blow on the door that made it
                    quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back
                    the wedges. A huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of
                    greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a
                    great, ﬂat, toeless foot was forced through below. There was
                    a dead silence outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his
                    might; but his sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his
                    shaken hand. The blade was notched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath
                    blaze up in his heart. &lsquo;The Shire!&rsquo; he cried,
                    and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, and stabbed with
                    Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot
                    jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo&rsquo;s arm.
                    Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the ﬂoor.
                    Boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;One for the Shire!&rsquo; cried Aragorn. &lsquo;The
                    hobbit&rsquo;s bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo
                    son of Drogo!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after
                    crash. Rams and hammers were beating against it. It cracked
                    and staggered back, and the opening grew suddenly wide.
                    Arrows came whistling in, but struck the northern wall, and
                    fell harmlessly to the ﬂoor. There was a horn-blast and a
                    rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the
                    chamber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many there were the Company could not count. The affray
                    was sharp, but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of
                    the defence. Legolas shot two through the throat. Gimli
                    hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on
                    Balin&rsquo;s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When
                    thir- teen had fallen the rest ﬂed shrieking, leaving the
                    defenders unharmed, except for Sam who had a scratch along
                    the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his
                    orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was
                    smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted
                    Sandyman step backwards, if he had seen it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Now is the time!&rsquo; cried Gandalf. &lsquo;Let us
                    go, before the troll returns!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had
                    reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost
                    man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into
                    the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the door-
                    way. His broad ﬂat face was swart, his eyes were like coals,
                    and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a
                    thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir&rsquo;s
                    sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground.
                    Diving under Aragorn&rsquo;s blow with the speed of a
                    striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with
                    his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the
                    right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and
                    pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it
                    broke. But even as the orc ﬂung down the truncheon and swept
                    out his scimitar, And&ucirc;ril came down upon his helm.
                    There was a ﬂash like ﬂame and the helm burst asunder. The
                    orc fell with cloven head. His followers ﬂed howling, as
                    Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Doom, doom</em> went the drums in the deep. The great
                    voice rolled out again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; shouted Gandalf. &lsquo;Now is the last
                    chance. Run for it!&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="chamberDoor">
                <p>
                    Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made
                    for the stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The
                    others followed; but Gimli had to be dragged away by
                    Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered by Balin&rsquo;s
                    tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door
                    to, grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on
                    either side, but could not be fastened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I am all right,&rsquo; gasped Frodo. &lsquo;I can
                    walk. Put me down!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. &lsquo;I
                    thought you were dead!&rsquo; he cried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Not yet!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;But there is no
                    time for wonder. Off you go, all of you, down the stairs!
                    Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if I do not
                    come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right
                    and downwards.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;We cannot leave you to hold the door alone!&rsquo;
                    said Aragorn. &lsquo;Do as I say!&rsquo; said Gandalf
                    fiercely. &lsquo;Swords are no more use here. Go!&rsquo;
                </p>

                <p>
                    The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They
                    groped their way down a long ﬂight of steps, and then looked
                    back; but they could see nothing, except high above them the
                    faint glimmer of the wizard&rsquo;s staff. He seemed to be
                    still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed
                    heavily
                </p>
                <p>
                    and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They
                    stood peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought
                    he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words
                    that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could
                    not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be trembling.
                    Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled:
                    <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white
                    light. Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The
                    drum-beats broke out wildly:
                    <em>doom-boom</em>, <em>doom-boom</em>, and then stopped.
                    Gandalf came ﬂying down the steps and fell to the ground in
                    the midst of the Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, well! That&rsquo;s over!&rsquo; said the wizard
                    struggling to his feet. &lsquo;I have done all that I could.
                    But I have met my match, and have nearly been destroyed. But
                    don&rsquo;t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without
                    light for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where
                    are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all
                    of you!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stumbled after him wondering what had happened.
                    <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom </em>went the drum-beats again: they
                    now sounded mufﬂed and far away, but they were following.
                    There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet,
                    nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the
                    passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired.
                    Every now and again it descended a ﬂight of steps, fifty or
                    more, to a lower level. At the moment that was their chief
                    danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until
                    they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness.
                    Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="stairs">
                <p>
                    At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a
                    little more, and had descended many ﬂights of stairs. There
                    was still no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope
                    that they would escape. At the bottom of the seventh ﬂight
                    Gandalf halted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;It is getting hot!&rsquo; he gasped. &lsquo;We ought
                    to be down at least to the level of the Gates now. Soon I
                    think we should look for a left-hand turn to take us east. I
                    hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a
                    moment, even if all the orcs ever spawned are after
                    us.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the
                    step. &lsquo;What happened away up there at the door?&rsquo;
                    he asked. &lsquo;Did you meet the beater of the
                    drums?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; answered Gandalf. &lsquo;But I
                    found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met
                    before. I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a
                    shutting-spell on the door. I know many; but to do things of
                    that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can
                    be broken by strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other
                    side: at any moment I thought they would burst it open. I
                    could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in
                    their own hideous language. All I caught was
                    <em>gh&#226;sh</em>: that is
                    &lsquo;&lsquo;fire&rsquo;&rsquo;. Then something came into
                    the chamber &#8211; I felt it through the door, and the orcs
                    themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the
                    iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt
                    such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly
                    broke me. For an instant the door left my control and began
                    to open! I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too
                    great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as
                    a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was
                    thrown back- wards down the stairs. All the wall gave way,
                    and the roof of the chamber as well, I think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something
                    else is buried there too. I cannot say. But at least the
                    passage behind us was completely blocked. Ah! I have never
                    felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what about you,
                    Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been
                    more delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that
                    it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn was
                    carrying.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;What about me?&rsquo; said Frodo. &lsquo;I am alive,
                    and whole I think. I am bruised and in pain, but it is not
                    too bad.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Aragorn, &lsquo;I can only say that
                    hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met
                    the like of it. Had I known, I would have spoken softer in
                    the Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a
                    wild boar!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,&rsquo;
                    said Frodo; &lsquo;though I feel as if I had been caught
                    between a hammer and an anvil.&rsquo; He said no more. He
                    found breathing painful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;You take after Bilbo,&rsquo; said Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said
                    of him long ago.&rsquo; Frodo wondered if the remark meant
                    more than it said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen
                    eyes in the dark. &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he said,
                    &lsquo;that there is a light ahead. But it is not daylight.
                    It is red. What can it be?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;<em>Gh&#226;sh! </em>&rsquo; muttered Gandalf.
                    &lsquo;I wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower
                    levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by
                    all. It was ﬂickering and glowing on the walls away down the
                    passage before them. They could now see their way: in front
                    the road sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood
                    a low archway; through it the growing light came. The air
                    became very hot.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="hall2">
                <p>
                    When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to
                    them to wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw
                    his face lit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;There is some new devilry here,&rsquo; he said,
                    &lsquo;devised for our welcome, no doubt. But I know now
                    where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the level
                    immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old
                    Moria; and the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end,
                    on the left, not more than a quarter of a mile. Across the
                    Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road, through the
                    First Hall, and out! But come and look!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It
                    was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had
                    slept. They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away
                    into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of
                    tower- ing pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty
                    trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery
                    of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow
                    was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the ﬂoor,
                    close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had
                    opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again
                    ﬂames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the
                    columns. Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;If we had come by the main road down from the upper
                    halls, we should have been trapped here,&rsquo; said
                    Gandalf. &lsquo;Let us hope that the fire now lies between
                    us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat:
                    <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em>. Away beyond the
                    shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and
                    horn-calls. <em>Doom, doom</em>: the pillars seemed to
                    tremble and the ﬂames to quiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Now for the last race!&rsquo; said Gandalf. &lsquo;If
                    the sun is shining outside, we may still escape. After
                    me!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    He turned left and sped across the smooth ﬂoor of the hall.
                    The distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran
                    they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind. A
                    shrill yell went up: they had been seen. There was a ring
                    and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo&rsquo;s
                    head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boromir laughed. &lsquo;They did not expect this,&rsquo; he
                    said. &lsquo;The fire has cut them off. We are on the wrong
                    side!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Look ahead!&rsquo; called Gandalf. &lsquo;The Bridge
                    is near. lt is dangerous and narrow.&rsquo;
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="intersector" data-ring-location="bridge1">
                <p>
                    Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of
                    the hall the ﬂoor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The
                    outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of
                    stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one
                    curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of
                    the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First
                    Hall and the outer passages. They could only pass across it
                    in single file. At the brink Gandalf halted and the others
                    came up in a pack behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Lead the way, Gimli!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Pippin
                    and Merry next.
                </p>
                <p>Straight on, and up the stair beyond the door!&rsquo;</p>
                <p>
                    Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back.
                    Another pierced Gandalf&rsquo;s hat and stuck there like a
                    black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw
                    swarming black figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs.
                    They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as
                    blood in the firelight. <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom </em>rolled
                    the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, <em>doom</em>,
                    <em>doom</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was
                    a long shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell,
                    and the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay
                    and fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs
                    of stone, and ﬂung them down to serve as gangways over the
                    fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with
                    terror. The ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded
                    away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was
                    coming up behind them. What it was could not be seen: it was
                    like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form,
                    of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror
                    seemed to be in it and to go before it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a
                    cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across
                    the fissure. The ﬂames roared up to greet it, and wreathed
                    about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its
                    streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right
                    hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left
                    it held a whip of many thongs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Ai! ai!&rsquo; wailed Legolas. &lsquo;A Balrog! A
                    Balrog is come!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gimli stared with wide eyes. &lsquo;Durin&rsquo;s
                    Bane!&rsquo; he cried, and letting his axe fall he covered
                    his face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;A Balrog,&rsquo; muttered Gandalf. &lsquo;Now I
                    understand.&rsquo; He faltered and leaned heavily on his
                    staff. &lsquo;What an evil fortune! And I am already
                    weary.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The
                    orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways. Then
                </p>
                <p data-sound="horn">
                    Boromir raised his horn and blew. Loud the challenge rang
                    and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under the
                    cavernous roof. For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery
                    shadow halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a ﬂame
                    blown out by a dark wind, and the enemy advanced again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Over the bridge!&rsquo; cried Gandalf, recalling his
                    strength. &lsquo;Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I
                    must hold the narrow way. Fly!&rsquo; Aragorn and Boromir
                    did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side
                    by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The
                    others halted just within the doorway at the hall&rsquo;s
                    end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the
                    enemy alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle
                    of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in
                    his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy
                    halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached
                    out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs
                    whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf
                    stood firm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;You cannot pass,&rsquo; he said. The orcs stood
                    still, and a dead silence fell. &lsquo;I am a servant of the
                    Secret Fire, wielder of the ﬂame of Anor. You cannot pass.
                    The dark fire will not avail you, ﬂame of Ud&#251;n. Go back
                    to the Shadow! You cannot pass.&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but
                    the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the
                    bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height,
                    and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still
                    Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed
                    small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened
                    tree before the onset of a storm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From out of the shadow a red sword leaped ﬂaming. Glamdring
                    glittered white in answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The
                    Balrog fell back, and its sword ﬂew up in molten fragments.
                    The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and
                    then again stood still.
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;You cannot pass!&rsquo; he said.</p>
                <p>
                    With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its
                    whip whirled and hissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;He cannot stand alone!&rsquo; cried Aragorn suddenly
                    and ran back along the bridge. &lsquo;<em>Elendil! </em
                    >&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;I am with you, Gandalf!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>&lsquo;Gondor!&rsquo; cried Boromir and leaped after him.</p>
                <p>
                    At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he
                    smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and
                    fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white ﬂame sprang
                    up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog&rsquo;s feet it
                    broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the
                    gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a
                    tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow
                    plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its
                    whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the
                    wizard&rsquo;s knees, dragging him to the brink. He
                    staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid
                    into the abyss. &lsquo;Fly, you fools!&rsquo; he cried, and
                    was gone.

                    The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company
                    stood rooted with horror staring into the pit. Even as
                    Aragorn and Boromir came ﬂying back, the rest of the bridge
                    cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Come! I will lead you now!&rsquo; he called.
                    &lsquo;We must obey his last command. Follow me!&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door,
                    Aragorn leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide
                    echoing passage. Along this they ﬂed. Frodo heard Sam at his
                    side weeping, and then he found that he himself was weeping
                    as he ran. <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em>, <em>doom </em>the
                    drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow;
                    <em>doom!</em>

                    They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts
                    pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall,
                    bright with daylight from its high windows in the east. They
                    ﬂed across it. Through its huge broken doors they passed,
                    and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of
                    blazing light.

                <p>
                    There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind
                    the great door-posts towering on either side, but the gates
                    were shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground
                    the captain that stood in his path, and the rest ﬂed in
                    terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took no
                    heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the
                    huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.

                    Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt
                    the wind on their faces.

                <p>
                    They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the
                    walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty
                    Mountains lay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden
                    light on the land. It was but one hour after noon. The sun
                    was shining; the clouds were white and high.

                <p>
                    They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under
                    the mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled
                    the slow drum-beats:
                    <em>doom</em>. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else
                    was to be seen; the dale all around was empty.
                    <em>Doom</em>. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they
                    wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the
                    ground. <em>Doom, doom</em>. The drum-beats faded.

                    around a shoulder of Mount Mindolluin. The city is sometimes
                    called <em>the White Tower</em>, a synecdoche for the city's
                    most prominent building in its Citadel, the seat of the
                    city's administration. The head of government is the Lord of
                    the City, a role fulfilled by the Stewards of Gondor. Other
                    officials include the Warden of the Houses of Healing and
                    the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys is in charge
                    of the city's security, especially its gates, and the
                    safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor;
                    he has command of the city when it is besieged by the forces
                    of Mordor.

                    Minas Tirith has seven walls: each wall holds a gate, and
                    for strength of defence each gate faces a different
                    direction from the next, facing alternately somewhat north
                    or south. Each level is about 100 ft higher than the one
                    below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall coloured
                    in white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle
                    (the lowest level), which is black, built of the same
                    material used for Orthanc. This outer wall is also the
                    tallest, longest and strongest of the city's seven walls; it
                    is vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the
                    ground where it stood. The Great Gate of Minas Tirith,
                    constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers
                    and bastions, is the main gate in the first or outer wall of
                    the city. In front of the Great Gate is a large paved area
                    called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith meet
                    here: the North-way; the South Road to the southern
                    provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to
                    the north-east of Minas Tirith. Except for the high saddle
                    of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the
                    city is surrounded by the Pelennor, an area of farmlands.

                <h2>Gondor</h2>
                <p>
                    Gondor was the most prominent kingdom of Men in
                    Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the north, Harad to the
                    south, the Cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and
                    Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath, moved
                    to Minas Anor in TA 1640. This city, later renamed
                    <button class="lore" type="button" data-value="minasTirith">
                        Minas Tirith</button
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion,
                    exiles from Númenor. Gondor was the sister kingdom of Arnor,
                    whose line of kings came from Isildur, while the line of the
                    Kings of Gondor descended from Anárion. Gondor was at the
                    height of its power in its early years due to the ships and
                    the military might that its armies possessed.
